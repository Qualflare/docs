# Workspaces

A **workspace** is the top-level container in Qualflare that brings teams together. It's where you organize your testing activities, manage team members, and control access to your projects.

## What is a Workspace?

Think of a workspace as your team's home base in Qualflare. All projects, test cases, launches, and results live within a workspace. Workspaces isolate data between different teams or organizations while providing collaboration features for members within.

## Workspace Hierarchy

```
Workspace (top level)
  ├── Project 1
  │   ├── Test Cases
  │   ├── Launches
  │   └── Results
  ├── Project 2
  └── Team Members
```

Everything in Qualflare belongs to a workspace. Projects are created within workspaces, and all testing activities happen within projects.

## Workspace Features

- **Team Management**: Invite members, assign roles, control permissions
- **Project Container**: Create multiple projects for different products or teams
- **Billing**: Subscription and usage tracking at workspace level
- **Settings**: Workspace-wide configuration and preferences
- **Isolation**: Data is isolated between workspaces for security and organization

## Use Cases

**Single Workspace**: Most companies use one workspace for the entire organization. All teams collaborate in the same space with separate projects for different products.

**Multiple Workspaces**: Large organizations or agencies may use multiple workspaces to:
- Separate different companies or clients
- Isolate environments (production vs staging testing)
- Provide completely independent teams with their own space

## Workspace Management

Workspaces are created during sign-up. After signing up, you can:
- Rename your workspace
- Invite team members
- Manage roles and permissions
- Configure workspace settings
- View billing and usage information

See the [Quick Start](/quick-start/) guide for workspace setup instructions.
